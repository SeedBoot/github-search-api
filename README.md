# github-search-api
Hello world! :metal:

This was made with a healthy glug of [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/), a handful of [Moment JS](https://momentjs.com/), a dash of [Babel JS](https://babeljs.io/) and a sprinkling of [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

This "app" runs on GitHub pages just fine. You can [view the page here](https://seedboot.github.io/github-search-api/).

Alternatively:
- Clone the repo locally
- Point your terminal to the directory and enter `npm install`
- The CLI will accept `npm run dev` or `npm run build` as accepted commands
- Open the index.html file or run http-server if you have it, and enjoy!

There should be no need to do this though, as it's quite a simple page!

:fire: Thanks for visiting! :fire:
